# Paddington
A game made for Birdie 2015 gamedev compo. Taking the opportunity to learn and explore Phaser.io library.

The challenge was to create a complete game given a fixed chunk of time. Keeping foucs of completing a playable game before a set deadline. The biggest learnings from this project, besides Phaser was prioritizing tasks that were most valuable for the project and not getting side tracked with effects, filters, pretty bling etc.
